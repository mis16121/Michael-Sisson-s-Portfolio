Derived systems of ODEs governing a particular construction CMC rotational hypersurfaces in de Sitter space, Anti-de Sitter space, and Hyperbolic space via an immersion $\phi: SF^l  x SF^k  x  \mathbb{R}\to SF^{n+1}$
Where $SF$ is either S(Sphere), AdS(Anti-de Sitter), dS(de Sitter), or H(Hyperbolic space) and n = l + k + 1
