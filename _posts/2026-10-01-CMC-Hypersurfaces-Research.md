I have been very fortunate to get the opportunity to work study CMC rotational hypersurfaces as an undergraduate and with a mixed theoretical/computational approach. Through this experience I have increased my mathematical maturity and sharpened my geometric intuition.

# Research Summary

- Derived systems of ODEs governing a particular construction CMC rotational hypersurfaces in de Sitter space, Anti-de Sitter space, and Hyperbolic space via an immersion $\phi: SF^l \times SF^k  \times  \mathbb{R}\to SF^{n+1}$
Where $SF$ is either S(Sphere), AdS(Anti-de Sitter), dS(de Sitter), or H(Hyperbolic space) and n = l + k + 1

- Discovered new families of embedded CMC surfaces in $S^4$ 

- Analyzed symmetry break bifurcations in parameter space and their behavior from $S^4$ through $S^{24}$

- Worked on coordinate transformation of ODE systems and the associated solution algorithm

- Utilized Mathematica extensively
    - to deploy numerical methods to evaluate systems of ODEs.
    - to produce, aggregate, and visually organzing large sets of data.
    - work with algorithms to reduce error
