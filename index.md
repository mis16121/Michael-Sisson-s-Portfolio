## About Me

I am a dual **mathematics-physics** major at the University of Connecticut, graduating in the Spring of 2027. I am interested in interdisciplinary collaboration, deploying theory and computational methods from mathematics and physics to better understand complex adaptive systems and other phenomena across various scientific domains. Of particular interest to me is the intersection of mathematics, physics, and biology, especially geometric approaches to biomechanical systems and their configuration spaces. 

Cumulative GPA: *3.852*

Research and Projects:

**Constant Mean Curvature (CMC) Rotational Hypersurfaces**
- Research focusing on the discovery and analysis of new families of CMC rotational hypersurfaces on spheres.
- Computational + purely mathematical approaches utilized to discover new families + prove their existence.

**Project + Presentation on Principles of Robot Motion and Configuration Manifolds**
- Covered topics including
  -configuration space topology and dimension
  -obstacles and path planning problems
  -matrix representations of rigid body configurations (SO(n) and SE(n))
  -transformations between configuration and velocity representations
